## Vulnerability Title
 Inconsistent Error Handling Across Functions

## Vulnerability Details
The contract uses a mix of require statements and manual checks for delegation success. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and potential oversights.

## Impact
Inconsistent error handling can make the contract harder to audit and may lead to overlooked error conditions in future updates.

## Proof of Concept
Compare these two error handling approaches in the same contract:
```
// Manual check
(bool success, bytes memory data) = _getExecutorAdmin().delegatecall(...);
require(success, string(data));

// Using directDelegate
function createPoolD650E2D0(...) external {
    directDelegate(_getExecutorAdmin());
}
```

## Tools Used
  Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Standardize error handling across the contract. Consider creating a helper function for delegation that includes consistent error checking.
