### [L-1]: All events are disabled

An `events` macro used for generating events has been disabled using a feature flag. As a consequence, no events are emitted.

**Recommendation**
Enable events by removing the flag `#[cfg(feature = "log-events")]` from all its instances and update the stylus-sdk to the latest version.

### [L-2]: The accumulated fees can overflow, and this is acknowledged in the comments.

Although this is mentioned in the comments ([position.rs#L77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-superposition/blob/29726230b13f1cf36c925d732d3eca459af1aff5/pkg/seawater/src/position.rs#L77)), it should also be clearly stated in the documentation to avoid potential contentions.

### [L-3] Open TODO in the code.

In `error.rs`, there is an open `TODO` which indicates that the code is not production-ready.

**Recommendation**
Implement the comment in the `TODO` or remove it.

### [L-4]: Wrong variable naming when getting upper tick in `lib.rs`

The `position_tick_upper_67_F_D_55_B_A` function's variable `lower` is used to store the value of an upper tick. This decreases readability and might lead to confusion in the future.

```solidity
    #[allow(non_snake_case)]
    pub fn position_tick_upper_67_F_D_55_B_A(
        &self,
        pool: Address,
        id: U256,
    ) -> Result<i32, Revert> {
        let lower = self.pools.getter(pool).get_position_tick_upper(id);
        Ok(lower.sys())
    }
```

**Recommendation**
Rename the variable`lower`to`upper`in the`position_tick_upper_67_F_D_55_B_A`function.
